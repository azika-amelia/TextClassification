# TextClassification
Text Classification in Python Using PyDev

### Data:
Amazon Reviews for Alexa are being categorised into 3 categories to indicate where the user sentiment were Positive, Negative or Neutral

### Preprocessing:
So far the problem is treated in a very simple manner therefore only a few basic preprocessing techinques are practiced. To conver the textual data into numerical data,TF-IDF was used.

### Models:
This file trains two models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, and ANN for text classification. Naive Bayes gives a better score than ANN, because no such parameter tuning has been done.
